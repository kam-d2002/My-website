      <h3 class="carp-sub-title">C.A.R.P is a set of design principles</h3>
      <p> The task at hand was to design posters for a film
           festival called True/ False, whilst thinking about
           these design principles.</p>
           <h4 class="summarised">C.A.R.P summarised</h4>
           <li>Contrast - When two clashing/ opposite elements (ex. dark & light, bold & thin) are used together in a design
               to compliment eachother.</li>
               <br>
        <li>Alignment - The way contents are layed out in a design, what angle they are at etc, can
            be used to visually connect elements.</li>
            <br>
        <li> Repetition - Consistency in design. An ongoing pattern of presenting the 
            contents to visually differ the different contents and aid understanding.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Proximity - The way contents are placed together to show they
            are related and clarify the different sections of the design.
        </li>
    </div>

    <h2 class="dev-title"> Initial designs.</h2>
    <p class="first3"> These are the first 3 pieces I designed but there was much more improvement to be done. </p>

    <!-- CARP posters -->
    <p class="poster-explanation"> When thinking about contrast, I thought it would be good to 
        include different font styles (blocky, curved etc). 
        Also, I made sure to include some white to balance 
        the dark colours. I successfully implemented
        the proximity principal in the first two posters
        by connecting related information together with
        the layout. In reflection, the placement of text could 
        be improved and there could be more proximity
        in the upper section of the poster. Alignment was
        implemented all through the design but with feedback
        and reflection, I concluded i'd aligned the contents too
        much and need to work on this. Moving on, I needed to make sure 
        to implement the repetition principal and work on improving 
        use of the other principals. It was also suggested to add images
        to the film, so this was experimented with too.</p>
        <h3 class="dev-title"> Poster development.</h3>
        <img class="posters-2" src="images/CARP-poster-dev1.jpg">
        <img class="posters-2" src="images/posterdev2.jpg">
        <p class="poster-explanation"> I played with the layout to remove a bit of the excessive orderliness,
        I made the logo text come in from different sides and was happy with how this looked. 
        I decided to make the slogan smaller to "marry" it in with the logo, this was to improve 
        the proximity and it seemed fitting to have the slogan go below the logo. The varying
        fonts also provide contrast. I felt it was necessary to change the website name to the same font 
        as the date and location to implement the repetition principal, this is to relate these two pieces
        to the audience as they are both key information on the page. I placed an image in the lower part of the 
        poster and thought this didn't look great so removed this. I decided the film looked better split up to
        add a sectioned look to the page so it breaks the contents up a bit.
         I played with the placement of the website address to see where it would fit in nicely.
         I decided to put it on an angle to further
        mess with the previous orderly look. During this, also implementing ideas of alignment as it 
        placed on the angled line of the film camera vector. I messed with the sizing of the top contents
        to see if that would improve the look and bring the content together nicely. I was happy with 
        the result so I decided to keep it. The next step was to experiment with adding images to the film for 
        the final poster.</p>
        <h3 class="dev-title"> Final design.</h3>
        <img class="final-poster" src="images/POSTER4.jpg">
        <p class="poster-explanation"> I finally settled on this design, I placed some relevant images into the film and made the layout more 
         interesting and less orderly. I am now going to summarise my implementation of the C.A.R.P design principles.</p>
         <p class="poster-explanation"> 
         Contrast - The varied text styles/ shape and usage of bright/ dark colours provides contrast.
         <br>
         Alignment - This principal was thoroughly experimented with when placing the text/ contents in.
         I discovered alignment can be a good or bad thing depending on the scenario.
         <br>
         Repetition - This principal was implemented in the form of signifying certain information with the same font, 
         to symbolise to the user which information is related/ important.
         <br>
         Proximity - The grouping of information provides proximity, making the poster clearer to intepret for the user.

        <h1> Reflection on task. </h1>
        <p> This task was brilliant for developing our design skills and learning to work to 
            a professional standard. It is important to consider design principles whenever 
            you are working on a piece so it has been handy to practice this. I am happy 
            with my final result, I feel I experimented with the poster to a sufficient level
            and considered a good variation of layout ideas. The experimentation and
            feedback helped me reach a nicely developed outcome to add to my graphic
            design portfolio. Also, in conclusion I think I've definitely become more
            comfortable with the world of design principles and I am happy with my 
            implementation of them.
