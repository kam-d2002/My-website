         <h1 class="Typography-title"> Typography task.</h1>
         <h2 class="Typography"> The aim of this task was to research 8 typographic design systems. </h2>
         <ol>-Radial </ol>
         <ol>-Axial  </ol>
         <ol>-Transitional </ol>
         <ol>-Dilational </ol>
         <ol>-Modular </ol>
         <ol>-Bilateral</ol>
         <ol>-Grid </ol>
         <ol>-Random </ol>
        <p class="paragraph1">and then we got to try designing them ourselves. We we're only allowed to use 
          one font so I used futura, as it's a modern font that I like. Also, we're also only allowed to use
          black and one other colour so I did a variety of designs with colour and some
          with only black and white, putting some research findings in for the text content.  </p>
        <h2 class="design-title"> Designs</h2>
        <div> 
        <h3> Radial</h3>
        <img class="typography-img" src="images/RADIAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM.jpg">
        <p class="systems-explained">This system involves having text orientate around a point.
            I like the way Radial typographic design looks, it was fun to experiment with.
            I liked incorporating the circle to radiate the text from.
            I can picture this system being useful for artistic abstract pieces or possibly
            an infographic. 
        <h3> Axial</h3>
        <img class="typography-img" src="images/AXIAL TYPOGRAPHC SYSTEM.jpg">
        <p class="systems-explained"> This system involves putting the text on an Axis. 
        This makes for an interesting look and can be a great way to guide the viewers eyes
        around your design. I am happy with my result, there is lots of ways you can 
        experiment with Axial design, I chose to go for a zig zag style. 
        </p>
        <h3> Transitional </h3>
        <img class="typography-img" src="images/TRANSITIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM.jpg">
        <p class="systems-explained"> This system involves having text ascend/ descend
            from a point (showing a transition). In this case, I had my text ascending. 
            This system is great for artistic designs, in my design I tried to go for a 
            basic hill/ mountain shape for the text to ascend upwards. I'm happy with 
            the result but there is room for improvement. </p>
        <h3> Dilational</h3>
        <img class="typography-img" src="images/DILATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM.jpg">
        <p class="systems-explained"> This system was very fun to experiment with, just like 
            a radial system the text has a central point. However, in this system the text dilates and 
            expands instead of going around the radius. This makes for an interesting artistic effect
            which i really like. To improve, I could of had more complex expansions with the text slowly
            getting smaller but I'm happy with my design for a first encounter with this system. </p>
        <h3> Modular</h3>
        <img class="typography-img" src="images/MODULAR TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM.jpg">
        <p class="systems-explained"> The modular typographic system involves using repeat elements to seperate content. 
            You can use shapes (circles or squares for example, I chose circles). The elements
            do not have to be ordered or equal in size which leaves room for experimentation.
            I like the way this system looks, I think it would be great for poster designs. </p>
        <h3> Bilateral</h3>
        <img class="typography-img" src="images/BILATERAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM.jpg">
        <p class="systems-explained"> Traditionally, Bilateral means centered text. This is a very basic typographic
            system so its neccessary to experiment with layout to make these designs more
            exciting. I decided to play with tilting to make the design more interesting.
            I also incorporated a shape to angle the content around. I am happy with how 
            this look for a limited typographic system.</p>
        <h3> Grid </h3>
        <img class="typography-img" src="images/GRID TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM.jpg">
        <p class="systems-explained"> Grid designs are tidy, ordered layouts. Breaking up content
        into sections. I decided to go for a traditional, even, squared grid design. This 
        system is great for formal designs that need to be tidy. For example, grids will be used
        in newspapers.  </p>
        <h3> Random </h3>
        <img class="typography-img" src="images/RANDOM TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM.jpg">
        <p class="systems-explained"> Finally, the random typographic system. This one was definitely
            the most fun to experiment with, as it has no boundaries. This system gives the designer
            the room to play with layout/ font sizes/ styles to whatever extent they please. 
            This system is perfect for artistic pieces.

         <h1> Reflection on task. </h1>
         <p> This task aswell as the C.A.R.P task was great for developing 
             our design skills, helping us learn how to use layout and 
             shape efficiently. I am happy with what I have taken from 
             this task and have gained ideas that I can incorporate
             into my future designs. I feel that this task has gave
             me a better idea of how to use layout professionally
             and has also got me thinking about which systems are useful
             for different scenarios/ contexts which is important to
             think about for fit for purpose design.
