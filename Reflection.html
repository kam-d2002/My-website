            Overall, I am very happy and proud of my results in this semester.
             Going from learning the basics of HTML and CSS to having my own 
             fully functional website in the space of a few months has been
              amazing and I’ve gained valuable skills in the process. For example, 
              flexbox rundown taught us the fundamentals of page grids and layout 
              and served as a valuable tool for building our own websites.
               We also learnt how to embed external style sheets with adobe
                fonts, so we could add an exciting flair to our pages. 
                It was nice to be able to present our work in a way that
                allows us to show our personal artistic design flairs. In 
                combination with a rounded presentation of what we have learnt, 
                I feel my website is a really good summary of my learning in
                this module so far. The workshops also gave us loads of 
                new skills in relation to CSS. Primarily, teaching us 
                how to make classes to alter specific page sections, change 
                text sizes and colours etc. However, more excitingly I learnt
                how to use CSS to do some really fun alterations to my site contents.
                 For example, the navigation buttons. We learnt how to use CSS to give 
                 the buttons motion and allow them to change colour when the mouse hovers over.
                  Another important skill we learnt was embedding links. This was essential
                   for navigation to the separate HTML pages and to take the user to our 
                   Github Respositories. Moving on, the C.A.R.P and typographic system
                    tasks were a great insight into the graphic design world. Moving away
                     from the technialities of code, we got to get in touch with our graphic
                      designer side, learning how to use design principles and fundamental ways
                       to layout text. These tasks definitely helped me explore my design ability 
                       and improve on it, gaining new skills. One of my favourite things to do 
                       with the page was colour schemes. I made sure to include a variety of 
                       colours throughout the different pages. This was to capture the feel of 
                       each theme. In the process though, I made sure not to over do it so there
                        wasn’t any colour clashing, I am happy with the look of each page and 
                        I feel the colours compliment eachother nicely. To improve, I would of 
                        liked to have altered the UX page layout to a better standard and also 
                        properly implemented the carousel image viewer (althought it works, it 
                        could of worked better) but unfortunately time wasn’t on my side towards
                         the end. Another thing I would of liked to added was a youtube video link, 
                         just to present this in the site. I did learn how to do this in the lesson 
                         so I can make sure to include a youtube link in a future website. 
                         Although there is definite room for improvement, I don’t feel I have 
                         reached a negative outcome and I am really happy with what I
                          have achieved overall. This module has been very interesting and
                           I look forward to the next semester!  </p>
